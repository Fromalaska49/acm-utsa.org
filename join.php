					<h1>Joining ACM</h1>
					<p>
						Membership in ACM UTSA is on a semester-basis.
						There are only two simple membership requirements:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Attend our general meetings</li>
						<li><a href="dues">Pay our membership dues</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Once you pay your dues, you will become a full member of
						ACM UTSA and enjoy all of the benefits. We strongly believe
						that membership participation is vital to creating a fun
						and engaging experience, so the only thing we ask of our
						members is to actively participate in our meetings and events.
